## Project Management

Trello Board Link: https://trello.com/b/vcGGvVN7/mern-stack-assessment

Starting with the planning stage of the project, after thoroughly going over the criteria of the assignment and Rubrik, Our team started with Minimum Viable Product (MVP) ideas. Starting with a Trello board, We split up the assignment's MVP requirements into To-Do cards as well as MVP user stories. The cards include checklists, dates to be completed as well as colour coded labels (red being MVP, most important) to highlight their importance as well as their difficulty/time cost. After the Trello board we set up and layout our Git Repositories adding each of the group users ready for collaborationa and rest of the project. 

Our team refers back to the Trello board at least every morning and afternoon, if not every time we finish a tasks.  Most important cards are discussed first and ee move cards that we aim to do on that day into the "Doing" column, move cards into the "Done" column when they are complete as well as constantly adding more User Stories and To Dos to their columns to at least aim to complete.

Throughout the day, things that come into mind that will need doing or may cause errors, later on, are noted via a shared Google Docs, commented on in our shared repository and even added to the Trello in the appropriate area.
